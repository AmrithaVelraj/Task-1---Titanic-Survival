ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ CodSoft Internship (Task 1)

This project is part of my Data Science Virtual Internship with CodSoft. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on given attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and embarkation point.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner datasets for machine learning. In this project, I perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training to predict passenger survival.
